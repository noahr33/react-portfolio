# React + Vite

WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories

WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required

WHEN I enter text into the email address field
THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address

WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
